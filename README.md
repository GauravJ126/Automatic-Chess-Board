# Automatic-Chess-Board
Combining the hall sensor project and the robotic arm project, I have implemented the SunFish chess engine to play chess.

Go through the details in the Hall-Sensor-Grid and the Robotic-arm-using-Double pendulum.

The sunfish code is also available on GitHub - https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish

This code was altered to take inputs from the Hall sensor and the output was translated as commands into the robotic arm.
